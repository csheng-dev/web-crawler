website_1.py is crawler code for https://www.openpetition.de.

website_2.py is crawler code for https://www.change.org/search.

In the folder webcrawl_result_v2.0, the crawled results are given. Results from website 2 might be useful. 

Results from website 1 could now only contain petition titles and links. In order to get more info from website 1, we need to open each petition link one by one to crawl the info. Because the number of links is large, so proxy might be needed.
